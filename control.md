# Take Control of your Camera Settings
One of the best ways to learn photography is to get yourself out of Auto mode. Since your camera sensor is only guessing based on limited information, and often guesses wrong, it can be a better practice to turn these auto modes off while you are practicing, and only turn them on when you intend to use them for a particular photo. 

## Apple iPhone:
**Preserve Settings:**
  1. Tap on Settings
  2. Scroll down to Camera and tap to open
  3. Tap on Preserve Settings and turn off Camera Mode and Filter, turn on Live Photo. Tap on Camera to go back to the Camera menu.
  4. Turn on Grid, and turn off Auto HDR.

**Flash:**
  1. Open your default Camera app
  2. Tap the flash (lightning bolt) icon in the top left corner and tap Off. 

**HDR:**
  1. In your default Camera app, tap HDR at the top
  <img src="images//photo-control-01.png" style="float:right" alt=HDR settings> 
  2. Tap Off (Note: if you don’t see “HDR” at the top of the camera app, you need to go to your home screen and then **Settings -> Camera -> Auto HDR** and then turn it off).
  3. If HDR is not at the top, go into your main photo settings, go down to Camera and scroll to the bottom to turn off auto HDR, and then go back to the Camera app and complete step 1 and 2.

**Live Photos:**
  1. In your Camera app, tap the Live icon (circles in the centre top) if there is no line crossed through it.

## Android Phones:
(These tools and settings may vary from model to model, so you may need to consult your manufacturer's manual if these instructions do not work for you. In some phones, you may need to look for a “Pro” mode to find some controls.)

**Flash:**
  1. Open your default Camera app
  2. Tap the flash (lightning bolt) icon at the top and tap Off <br>
**OR**<br>
  3. Tap the Control icon (circle with a small lightning bolt at the bottom right) and then tap the lightning bolt. 
  4. Tap the lightning bolt icon that has a line through it (Off)

**HDR:**
  - Tour default Camera app, if there is HDR at the top, see if it is crossed out. If yes, it is already off. If there is no line through the letters, tapping once should disable it and cross it out.<br>
	**OR**<br>
  - Tap the Control icon to get into Camera settings. If HDR is crossed out, it is already off. If there is no line through the letters, tapping once should disable it and cross it out.
