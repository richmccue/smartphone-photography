## Why Smartphone Photography? 

Smartphone photography focuses on using your mobile device to take beautiful pictures. Just because you don't have a big fancy camera, or the newest smartphone, you can still take amazing photos with whichever smartphone camera you currently own. Throughout the following activities, you will become more familiar with your smartphone camera app and become a better photographer as you learn about critical elements such as lighting, the story you are trying to tell and photo editing on your smartphone.

## Learning objectives

1. Set focus and exposure manually in a smartphone camera app
